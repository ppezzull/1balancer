### ‚ö†Ô∏è EscrowFactory
- **Transaction**: `0x9c18286f5f66fb363040b6f10681cbdb33f0db37baca7c396e11c466ca1e358c`
- **Status**: Transaction failed due to gas limit
- **Action Required**: Redeploy with higher gas limit

## Summary

1. **FusionPlusHub**: ‚úÖ Successfully deployed
2. **EscrowFactory**: ‚ùå Needs redeployment due to gas limit issue

The EscrowFactory deployment failed because it deploys two implementation contracts inline (EscrowSrc and EscrowDst), which requires more gas than the 8M limit we set.

## Next Steps

To complete the deployment:

1. **Redeploy EscrowFactory** with higher gas limit:
   ```bash
   make deploy-base-escrow
   ```

2. **Check deployment status**:
   ```bash
   make fusion-plus-status
   ```

3. **Connect to NEAR** (already deployed):
   - NEAR HTLC contracts are ready
   - Start orchestration service: `make orchestrator-dev`

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check current status
make fusion-plus-status

# List deployed contracts
make base-contracts

# Check account balance
make account-status
```

## Notes

- Your deployer account has sufficient funds (0.35 ETH)
- FusionPlusHub is ready for use
- EscrowFactory needs redeployment with adjusted gas settings
