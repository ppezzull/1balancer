# Fusion+ Demo Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit documents the end-to-end testing of the 1Balancer Fusion+ demo workflow on a local blockchain. The test validates the implementation of cross-chain atomic swaps between BASE (Ethereum L2) and NEAR Protocol using 1inch's Fusion+ architecture.

## Test Environment

- **Date**: August 2, 2025  
- **Network**: Local Hardhat blockchain (localhost:8545)
- **Components Tested**:
  - Local blockchain deployment
  - Smart contract deployment
  - Orchestrator service
  - Makefile workflow

## Workflow Steps Executed

### 1. Local Blockchain Setup ✅

```bash
make chain
```

**Result**: Successfully started Hardhat local blockchain on port 8545
- Generated 20 test accounts with 10,000 ETH each
- Default account: `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`

### 2. Contract Deployment ✅

```bash
make deploy
```

**Result**: Successfully deployed all contracts to localhost
- **YourContract**: `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`
- **BalancerFactory**: `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`
- **FusionPlusHub (Proxy)**: `0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9`
- **FusionPlusHub (Implementation)**: `0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9`
- **ProxyAdmin**: `0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0`

**Note**: Using placeholder addresses for 1inch contracts as they're not deployed to BASE testnet yet:
- Escrow Factory: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003`
- Limit Order Protocol: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001`
- Aggregation Router: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002`

### 3. Orchestrator Service ✅

```bash
make orchestrator-dev
```

**Result**: Successfully started orchestrator service
- Running on port 8080
- WebSocket server on ws://localhost:8080/ws
- API documentation available at http://localhost:8080/api-docs
- Connected to:
  - BASE Sepolia RPC: https://sepolia.base.org
  - NEAR Testnet RPC: https://rpc.testnet.near.org
- NEAR account configured: `rog_eth.testnet`

**Warnings Observed**:
- Invalid NEAR private key format - running in read-only mode
- NEAR contract `fusion-htlc.testnet` does not exist yet (expected in development)

### 4. Local Demo Execution ⚠️

```bash
make fusion-plus-local
```

**Result**: Partial success
- All prerequisites checked successfully
- Demo script (`scripts/fusion-plus-demo-local.js`) not found
- Fallback to test suite attempted

## Makefile Improvements Implemented

### 1. Fixed Deploy Command
Modified the `make deploy` command to:
- Check if local blockchain is running before deployment
- Use default Hardhat accounts for localhost (no password required)
- Added clear error messages and next steps

### 2. Added Local Demo Command
Created `make fusion-plus-local` command that:
- Verifies all prerequisites (chain, contracts, orchestrator)
- Provides clear status for each component
- Falls back to test suite if demo script is missing

### 3. Enhanced Deploy-Base Command
Updated with:
- Clear instructions for funding accounts
- Alternative direct deployment commands
- Links to BASE Sepolia faucets

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Demo Script
- `scripts/fusion-plus-demo-local.js` does not exist
- Need to create this script for complete demo experience

### 2. NEAR Configuration
- NEAR private key format issue in orchestrator
- Contract not deployed to NEAR testnet
- Running in read-only mode limits functionality

### 3. Proxy Scripts
- `chalk` module import issues in proxy scripts
- Fixed by updating to ESM imports

## Recommendations

### 1. Create Local Demo Script
```javascript
// scripts/fusion-plus-demo-local.js
// Implement a complete demo flow showing:
// - Session creation
// - Quote generation
// - Swap execution
// - Event monitoring
```

### 2. Fix NEAR Integration
- Deploy NEAR contracts to testnet
- Fix private key format in `.env`
- Update orchestrator to handle local NEAR simulation

### 3. Complete Test Suite
- Add `FusionPlusLocal.test.ts` for local testing
- Include integration tests for all components

## Conclusion

The Fusion+ demo infrastructure is functional with the following status:
- ✅ Local blockchain deployment works
- ✅ Smart contracts deploy successfully  
- ✅ Orchestrator service runs properly
- ⚠️ Demo script needs implementation
- ⚠️ NEAR integration needs configuration

The Makefile workflow has been improved to provide better UX with:
- Clear error messages
- Helpful next steps
- Alternative commands for troubleshooting
- Local-first approach to save testnet costs

## Next Steps

1. Create the missing demo script
2. Fix NEAR configuration for full functionality
3. Add comprehensive integration tests
4. Document the complete swap lifecycle

**Audit performed by**: Claude
**Tool**: 1Balancer Fusion+ Demo
**Status**: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL - Core infrastructure working, demo script needed

## Final Service Status Check

- ✅ Local blockchain: Running on http://localhost:8545
- ✅ Orchestrator service: Running on http://localhost:8080
- ✅ Contracts deployed: All core contracts deployed to localhost
- ⚠️ Frontend: Not started (use `make frontend` to start)
- ⚠️ Demo script: Missing (needs implementation)
