# Fusion+ Local Implementation Knowledge

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Local Blockchain**: Hardhat node running on localhost:8545
2. **Deployed Contracts**:
   - YourContract: `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`
   - BalancerFactory: `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`
   - FusionPlusHub: `0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9`
   - ProxyAdmin: `0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0`
3. **Orchestrator**: Running on localhost:8080 with health endpoint working
4. **Scripts**: All chalk import issues fixed

### ⚠️ Issues Requiring Full Implementation
1. **NEAR Operations**: Currently fails because orchestrator tries real NEAR operations
2. **Local NEAR Simulation**: Need to implement NEAR operations on EVM for local testing
3. **Complete Flow**: Demo stops at execution due to NEAR dependency

## Implementation Strategy for Full Local Blockchain Operations

### Option 1: Mock NEAR Contract on EVM (Recommended)
Deploy a MockNEARHTLC contract on the local EVM chain that simulates NEAR behavior:
```solidity
contract MockNEARHTLC {
    mapping(bytes32 => HTLC) public htlcs;
    
    struct HTLC {
        address sender;
        address receiver;
        uint256 amount;
        bytes32 hashlock;
        uint256 timelock;
        bool withdrawn;
        bool refunded;
    }
    
    function create(/*params*/) external payable { }
    function withdraw(bytes32 preimage) external { }
    function refund() external { }
}
```

### Option 2: Local NEAR Node
Run a local NEAR node alongside Hardhat, but this is complex and resource-intensive.

### Option 3: Dual-Chain Simulation
Use two separate Hardhat instances on different ports to simulate BASE and NEAR.

## Required Changes for Full Local Implementation

### 1. Deploy Mock NEAR Contract
```bash
# In packages/hardhat/contracts/
MockNEARHTLC.sol - Simulates NEAR HTLC behavior on EVM
```

### 2. Update Orchestrator Configuration
```typescript
// For local mode, use Mock NEAR contract address instead of NEAR RPC
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'local') {
  this.nearConfig = {
    networkId: 'local',
    nodeUrl: 'http://localhost:8545',
    htlcContract: process.env.MOCK_NEAR_HTLC_ADDRESS
  };
}
```

### 3. Create Local Demo Flow
1. Deploy all contracts including MockNEARHTLC
2. Configure orchestrator to use local contracts
3. Execute full atomic swap using EVM for both chains
4. Monitor events and state changes

## Key Files to Modify

1. **packages/hardhat/contracts/MockNEARHTLC.sol** - New contract
2. **packages/hardhat/deploy/05_deploy_mock_near.ts** - Deployment script
3. **packages/orchestrator/src/core/NEARChainCoordinator.ts** - Add local mode
4. **scripts/fusion-plus-demo-local.js** - Update to use local contracts

## Environment Variables for Local Mode
```env
# Local mode configuration
LOCAL_MODE=true
MOCK_NEAR_HTLC_ADDRESS=0x... # After deployment
BASE_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
NEAR_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545 # Same as BASE for local
```

## Commands Sequence for Full Local Demo
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Blockchain
make chain

# Terminal 2 - Deploy contracts
make deploy
make deploy-mock-near  # New command needed

# Terminal 3 - Orchestrator with local config
LOCAL_MODE=true make orchestrator-dev

# Terminal 4 - Run demo
make fusion-plus-local
```

## Next Steps
1. Create MockNEARHTLC contract
2. Add deployment script
3. Update orchestrator for local mode
4. Test complete flow end-to-end
